# keylogger

If you're trying to get better at typing with your keyboard, you'll love to know what are the most common mistakes and fixes you make. Keylogger helps you find hiccups by recording your keystrokes. Just launch Keylogger on the console and your keystrokes will be recorded in the keylogger.txt file.
If you pause for more than 10 seconds, Keylogger inserts a line break for easier reading. You can stop the keylogger at any time by pressing ESC.


## Usage
On the console, write: `./keylogger.py`
You can also start directly with python: `python3 keylogger.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3 installed on your PC


## Installation
Copy keylogger.py to your computer. Make the file executeable.
